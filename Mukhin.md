# Theory

The document appears to describe a method for constructing critical points of a master function $$\Phi$$ and explores how polynomials $$\boldsymbol{y} = (y_1(x), \dots, y_r(x))$$ represent these points. It relates to a population of such critical points, constructed using a process involving recurrence relations between the polynomials. Here's an overview of the key concepts:

1. **Master Function and Critical Points**: 
   - The master function $$\Phi(\boldsymbol{t}; \boldsymbol{z}; \overline{\boldsymbol{\Lambda}})$$ has critical points denoted by $$\boldsymbol{t} = (t_j^{(i)})$$. 
   - These critical points can be encoded by a set of polynomials $$\boldsymbol{y} = (y_1(x), \dots, y_r(x))$$, where each $$y_i(x)$$ is a product of terms $$(x - t_j^{(i)})$$.

2. **Representing Critical Points**:
   - The polynomials $$\boldsymbol{y}$$ are related to the points $$\boldsymbol{t}$$, but the representation focuses on the roots of these polynomials. A critical point is identified with its corresponding set of polynomials, ignoring the scaling of these polynomials by non-zero constants.

3. **Conditions for Genericity**:
   - A set of polynomials $$\boldsymbol{y}$$ is called "generic" if:
     - Each polynomial $$y_i(x)$$ has no multiple roots.
     - The roots of each $$y_i(x)$$ do not coincide with those of a related polynomial $$T_i(x)$$, which is constructed using weights $$\Lambda_i$$ and points $$z_i$$.
     - Different polynomials $$y_i(x)$$ and $$y_j(x)$$ have no common roots under certain conditions.

4. **Reproduction Procedure**:
   - Starting from a base pair of polynomials $$\boldsymbol{y}^0 = (1, 1)$$, a recursive process generates new pairs of polynomials by solving recurrence equations. This process produces pairs like:
     $$\boldsymbol{y} = \left(x + a, \frac{x^2}{2} + ax + b \right)$$
     and
     $$\boldsymbol{y} = \left( \frac{x^2}{2} + c x + ac - b, \frac{x^2}{2} + ax + b \right)$$
     where $$a$$, $$b$$, and $$c$$ are parameters. 

5. **Entire Population**:
   - The document concludes that the entire population of solutions is generated by this recursive process. Starting from $$\boldsymbol{y}^0 = (1,1)$$, all possible pairs of polynomials (subject to the conditions mentioned) can be constructed, and nothing else can arise.

In summary, the **entire population** of critical points is given by all the polynomials that can be recursively generated from the initial pair $$(1, 1)$$ using the described process. The polynomials are considered up to multiplication by non-zero constants and are associated with algebraic structures, such as flag varieties in certain vector spaces.

# Question 2 Approach

The document you uploaded contains an exercise related to a **rank 2 master function** and asks to compute critical points generated by specific values of $$\boldsymbol{y}$$ and $$\boldsymbol{l}$$.
Here's a breakdown of **Question 2** and how to solve it:
### Problem Statement
You are given a master function of rank 2, with two parts:
- **Master Function**:
  $$\Phi = \prod_{i < j} (t_i - t_j)^2 \prod_{i < j} (s_i - s_j)^2 \prod_{i, j} (t_i - s_j)^{-1} \prod_i t_i^i \prod_i s_i^{-3}$$
  
You need to:
1. Compute the **population of critical points** generated by:
   - The **trivial critical point**: $$\boldsymbol{y} = (1, 1)$$, $$\boldsymbol{l} = (0, 0)$$.
   - The **unique critical point** with $$\boldsymbol{l} = (1, 1)$$.
### Solution Method
#### Step 1: Understanding the Master Function
The master function $$\Phi$$ involves multiple products over pairs of variables $$ t_i$$ and $$ s_i$$. The critical points are derived by differentiating $$\Phi$$ with respect to these variables and setting the derivatives to zero.
The function involves:
- Differences between $$t_i$$ and $$t_j$$, contributing to singularities where the critical points lie.
- Interaction terms $$(t_i - s_j)^{-1}$$, which complicate the critical point structure by coupling the $$t$$'s and $$s$$'s.
- Polynomial terms involving powers of $$t_i$$ and $$s_i$$, which affect the nature of the critical points.
#### Step 2: Trivial Critical Point $$\boldsymbol{y} = (1, 1), \boldsymbol{l} = (0, 0)$$
For the trivial critical point:
- **Starting point**: $$\boldsymbol{y}^0 = (1, 1)$$ means that the initial polynomials are $$y_1(x) = 1$$ and $$y_2(x) = 1$$.
- **Recurrence relations**: Based on the form of the master function, the recurrence relations will be used to generate new solutions. These relations are derived from the equations of the form:
  $$W(y_1, \tilde{y}_1) = y_2 \quad \text{and} \quad W(y_2, \tilde{y}_2) = y_1$$
  Using these, we construct a family of solutions for different values of parameters.
For $$\boldsymbol{y}^0 = (1, 1)$$, after applying the recurrence relations, we get pairs like:
- $$\boldsymbol{y} = (x + a, 1)$$ for some parameter $$a$$.
- Then, solving the next recurrence gives more complex pairs like $$\boldsymbol{y} = (x + a, x^2 / 2 + ax + b)$$.
By continuing this procedure, we generate an entire population of critical points.
#### Step 3: Critical Point with $$\boldsymbol{l} = (1, 1)$$
For the unique critical point with $$\boldsymbol{l} = (1, 1)$$, we need to modify the initial polynomials accordingly:
- The polynomials $$ y_1(x) $$ and $$ y_2(x) $$ will now have degrees corresponding to $$\boldsymbol{l} = (1, 1) $$. This means that $$ y_1(x) $$ and $$ y_2(x) $$ will be linear polynomials initially:
  $$y_1(x) = x + a \quad \text{and} \quad y_2(x) = x + b$$
  for some constants $$a$$ and $$b$$.
  
From here, the recurrence relations can be used to generate further critical points as in the trivial case, but starting with these initial linear polynomials.
### Summary of the Process
The population of critical points is generated by starting from specific initial polynomials $$\boldsymbol{y}^0$$ and applying recurrence relations to build more complex solutions. The trivial case starts with constant polynomials, while the unique critical point with $$\boldsymbol{l} = (1, 1)$$ starts with linear polynomials. Both cases yield a family of solutions that forms the entire population of critical points.
Would you like further details on a specific part of the solution?

# Question 2 Solution

Let's walk through **Question 2** step by step with a full solution example. I will simplify the problem using the following approach:

### Problem Recap
You are asked to compute explicitly the population of critical points generated by:
- **a)** The trivial critical point $\boldsymbol{y} = (1,1)$, $\boldsymbol{l} = (0,0)$.
- **b)** The (unique) critical point with $\boldsymbol{l} = (1,1)$.

### Solution Outline
#### Part A: Trivial Critical Point $\boldsymbol{y} = (1,1)$, $\boldsymbol{l} = (0,0)$

1. **Initial Setup**: 
   - The critical point $\boldsymbol{y} = (1,1)$ means both polynomials $y_1(x) = 1$ and $y_2(x) = 1$ are constants.
   - The degree vector $\boldsymbol{l} = (0,0)$ indicates that the polynomials $y_1(x)$ and $y_2(x)$ have degree 0 (i.e., they are constants).

2. **Recurrence Relations**:
   The recurrence relations that define the critical points are:
   $$W(y_1, \tilde{y}_1) = y_2, \quad W(y_2, \tilde{y}_2) = y_1$$
   where $W(y_i, \tilde{y}_i)$ is a transformation that relates one polynomial to another.

   - Starting with $\boldsymbol{y}^0 = (1,1)$, the first relation becomes:
     $$W(1, \tilde{y}_1) = 1$$
     Solving this, we obtain:
     $$\tilde{y}_1 = 1$$
     and similarly for $y_2$, so the first pair of polynomials is $(1, 1)$, confirming that the trivial critical point remains unchanged in this step.

3. **Generating New Solutions**:
   Using the recurrence relations again, we can generate new pairs of polynomials. The next set is:
   $$\boldsymbol{y} = (x + a, 1)$$
   where $a$ is an arbitrary constant. This corresponds to a linear polynomial in the first coordinate and a constant in the second.

   Further iterations of the recurrence give:
   $$\boldsymbol{y} = \left( x + a, \frac{x^2}{2} + ax + b \right)$$
   where $a$ and $b$ are parameters. Thus, we now have a second-degree polynomial in the second coordinate and a linear polynomial in the first.

   Continuing this process generates more complex polynomials, but all are determined by this recursive structure.

4. **Population**:
   The entire population is composed of all pairs $\boldsymbol{y} = (y_1(x), y_2(x))$ generated from the recurrence relations starting with $\boldsymbol{y}^0 = (1, 1)$. The first few members of this population are:
   - $(1, 1)$
   - $(x + a, 1)$
   - $\left( x + a, \frac{x^2}{2} + ax + b \right)$
   - Further solutions with higher-degree polynomials.

#### Part B: Critical Point with $\boldsymbol{l} = (1,1)$

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - In this case, $\boldsymbol{l} = (1,1)$ means that the polynomials $y_1(x)$ and $y_2(x)$ are linear polynomials of degree 1.
   - The initial polynomials are of the form:
     $$y_1(x) = x + a, \quad y_2(x) = x + b$$
     where $a$ and $b$ are constants.

2. **Recurrence Relations**:
   Applying the recurrence relations to these linear polynomials:
   $$W(y_1, \tilde{y}_1) = y_2, \quad W(y_2, \tilde{y}_2) = y_1$$
   - For the first relation:
     $$W(x + a, \tilde{y}_1) = x + b$$
     Solving for $\tilde{y}_1$, we get:
     $$\tilde{y}_1 = \frac{x^2}{2} + ax + c$$
   - Similarly, solving the second relation gives a second-degree polynomial in $y_2$:
     $$\tilde{y}_2 = \frac{x^2}{2} + bx + d$$

3. **Population**:
   The population of critical points generated by $\boldsymbol{l} = (1,1)$ includes:
   - $(x + a, x + b)$
   - $\left( \frac{x^2}{2} + ax + c, x + b \right)$
   - Higher-degree polynomials generated by further iterations of the recurrence relations.

---

### Final Population for Part A and Part B:
- For part **A** (trivial critical point), the population consists of pairs of polynomials starting from $(1,1)$ and progressing through linear and higher-degree polynomials.
- For part **B** (unique critical point with $\boldsymbol{l} = (1,1)$), the population consists of linear polynomials progressing to quadratic and higher-degree polynomials.

---

### Summary

In **Question 2**, the populations are built starting from the given initial critical points and using recurrence relations. The solutions are:
- **Part A**: $(1,1)$, $(x + a, 1)$, $\left( x + a, \frac{x^2}{2} + ax + b \right)$, etc.
- **Part B**: $(x + a, x + b)$, $\left( \frac{x^2}{2} + ax + c, x + b \right)$, etc.

Now, you can use this process to solve **Question 3** by applying the same recurrence relations to the different master function provided.
